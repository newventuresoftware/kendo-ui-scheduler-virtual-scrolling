# Kendo UI Scheduler Virtual Scrolling

* A step-by-step tutorial can be found [here](https://newventuresoftware.com/blog).

## Description
Displaying too many resources in the Kendo UI Scheduler can seriously degrade the performance of the widget. Probably no significant issues will be faced if we're talking about 15-20 resources, however, if you have to display 100 resources all at once the scheduler might be very slow to load and respond. One possible solution is implementing virtual scrolling.
